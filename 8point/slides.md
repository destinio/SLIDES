The width and height properties include the content, padding, and border, but do not include the margin.

`total element size = (w + h) + (p + b)`

Design apps and prototyping tools allow you to create near perfect visions of what UI **could** look like.

--

But when it comes to digital product design, a mockup or prototypeâ€™s sole purpose is to communicate a **proposed** solution to stakeholders and developers.

--

In the end, only what a developer can reproduce in code **(in combination with assets)** can make it to production.

## Prioritize reducing time between ideation and coding **over** perfect layouts and prototypes

# The Goal

---

### Every UI element you create should be aligned to the pixel grid.

--

This is a concept known as pixel-fitting and it ensures that all of your elements appear crisp on a userâ€™s device.

## anti-aliasing??

## A note about text

Text is somewhat of an outlier here as the unique metrics that allow your eyes to read letters require a little bit of the **anti-aliasing** that makes other shapes blurry.

So, donâ€™t worry about every point of your letters aligning to the pixel grid.

The elements the text are in are the importaint part

# Dev Benifits

## Consistent UI

### When all of your measurements follow the same rules...

--

### ...you automatically get a more consistent UI.

--

### Fewer decisions = more time creating value (**_coding_**)

<!-- By removing 7 of every 8 spacing options, you reduce the amount of fiddling available to you and subsequently reduce speed to code. -->

---

## Multi-platform design

--

### Most popular screen sizes are divisible by 8 on at least one axis
