Design apps and prototyping tools allow you to create near perfect visions of what UI **could** look like.

--

But when it comes to digital product design, a mockup or prototype’s sole purpose is to communicate a **proposed** solution to stakeholders and developers.

--

In the end, only what a developer can reproduce in code **(in combination with assets)** can make it to production.

---

## Prioritize

Reducing time between ideation and programming **over** perfect layout in Sketch or Photoshop

# The Goal

---

Every UI element you create should be aligned to the pixel grid.

--

This is a concept known as pixel-fitting and it ensures that all of your elements appear crisp on a user’s device.

### A note about text

Text is somewhat of an outlier here as the unique metrics that allow your eyes to read letters require a little bit of the **anti-aliasing** that makes other shapes blurry.

So, don’t worry about every point of your letters aligning to the pixel grid.

The elements the text are in are the importaint part

# But Why?

--

### Consistent UI

When all of your measurements follow the same rules

You automatically get a more consistent UI.

--

### Fewer decisions = less time

<!-- By removing 7 of every 8 spacing options, you reduce the amount of fiddling available to you and subsequently reduce speed to code. -->

# But Why?

## Multi-platform design

---

Most popular screen sizes are divisible by 8 on at least one axis

# Icons

Icons often need to be different sizes to maintain the same visual weight.

Putting a frame around them, similar to how Hard Grid defines element sizes is a way to keep your measurements consistent, while allowing variation within defined parameters.
